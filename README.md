Deep Learning Project

FIP First Week Task

This repository contains my first deep learning practical task from the FIP (Foundations in AI/Deep Learning) training course. It includes a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates core deep learning concepts and hands-on experiments performed as part of the weekly curriculum.

🧠 About the Project

This project is an introductory deep learning exercise that walks through building and training deep learning models using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
The notebook showcases practical implementation of concepts learned during the first week of the training. These likely include tasks such as:

Loading and exploring datasets

Preprocessing input data for models

Defining and training neural network architectures

Visualizing model performance and learning curves

🧪 Actual tasks and model details are contained inside the Deeplearningprj.ipynb notebook.
